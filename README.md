# o-wow
o-wow is a mini open source transpiler one student has been working on since summer of 2025, it's primarily based for user key word customization and can support a variety of simple tasks. This is in it's buggy and more primitive phase and does primarily function in replit. This is a back/partial-front end made for small things.
